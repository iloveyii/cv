## Firebase config
  * Create a google account (google.com)
  * Goto firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
  * Add a project
  * Goto Project Overview and click Add app, select web (<>) and then follow the instructions.
  * From the above step you will get web app credentials.
  * To integrate with node js you need to install firebase-admin package
  * Goto Project settings ( gear icon)  > Service accounts and then click Generate new key, download it.
  * Now goto Real-time database and click ellipses (...) and then 'create new database'



## Issues and solution
   * The web app may not read the data initially from the realtime database
   * To fix it click Develop > Database > Real time database > Rules > then change read, write to 'true', then click publish.
   * Better to run command under root `sudo su`
   * Set home directory as `export NODEJS_HOME=/usr/share/nodejs/bin`
   * To set the display resolution `nano /boot/config.txt`, and set `hdmi_mode	16`.
   * sh: 1: node: Permission denied
```
npm config set user 0
npm config set unsafe-Color sensor started! 
perm true
```

## EDUCATION
   * `wget https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds/gpgkey`
   * `sudo apt-key add gpgkey`
   * `sudo -s`
   * `. <( wget -O - https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh )`
   * `apt-get install code-oss=1.29.0-1539702286`
   * This rolls back to an earlier version. This does mean if you run apt-get update at a later date the latest version will be installed, breaking it again. To stop this happening, you can lock the version using:
     
     `apt-mark hold code-oss`
     Once a fix has been released, you can remove the version lock with:
     
     `apt-mark unhold code-oss`
   
## Firebase functions
   * npm i -g firebase-tools
   * firebase login
   * firebase init functions
   * firebase deploy --only functions --debug

## SD card
   * Clone SD cards 
```bash
    sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=~/sda.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror status=progress
